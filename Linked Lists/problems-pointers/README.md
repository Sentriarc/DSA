Here are three beginner-friendly projects in C that involve pointers. Each project gradually introduces more pointer usage while keeping things manageable for someone new to pointers.
1. Swapping Two Numbers with Pointers

Objective: Use pointers to swap the values of two variables.

Description:

    Create a program that takes two numbers as input from the user.
    Use a function that takes pointers to these numbers and swaps their values.
    Print the values before and after swapping to confirm it works.

Key Concepts:

    Passing pointers to a function.
    Using dereferencing to access and modify values.



2. Simple Array Manipulation with Pointers

Objective: Work with arrays and pointers by creating a program to modify array elements.

Description:

    Write a program that takes an integer array and a target integer from the user.
    Create a function that takes a pointer to the array and its size, then modifies each element (e.g., adds the target integer to each element).
    Print the array before and after modification to confirm.

Key Concepts:

    Array indexing with pointers.
    Passing array pointers to functions.



3. Dynamic String Manipulation

Objective: Use pointers to create, manipulate, and display a string.

Description:

    Write a program that creates a character array for a string (like a simple text editor).
    Allow the user to input a string.
    Create a function that, using pointers, converts all lowercase characters to uppercase in the string.
    Print the modified string.

Key Concepts:

    Pointer arithmetic with characters.
    Manipulating strings via pointers.
