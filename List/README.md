This is a list of practice problems generated by ChatGPT.

Here are some practice problems focused on using lists (arrays) in C:

### 1. **Sum of Elements**
   Write a C program that:
   - Takes an integer `n` as input, which represents the number of elements in a list.
   - Then takes `n` integers as input.
   - Calculates and prints the sum of all the elements in the list.

### 2. **Find Maximum and Minimum**
   Write a C program that:
   - Takes an integer `n` as input, which represents the number of elements in a list.
   - Then takes `n` integers as input.
   - Finds and prints the maximum and minimum values in the list.

### 3. **Reverse the List**
   Write a C program that:
   - Takes an integer `n` as input, which represents the number of elements in a list.
   - Then takes `n` integers as input.
   - Reverses the list and prints the reversed list.

### 4. **Find the Second Largest Element**
   Write a C program that:
   - Takes an integer `n` as input, which represents the number of elements in a list.
   - Then takes `n` integers as input.
   - Finds and prints the second largest element in the list.

### 5. **Count Occurrences of a Number**
   Write a C program that:
   - Takes an integer `n` as input, which represents the number of elements in a list.
   - Then takes `n` integers as input.
   - Takes an additional integer `x` as input.
   - Counts and prints how many times `x` appears in the list.

### 6. **Remove Duplicates from a List**
   Write a C program that:
   - Takes an integer `n` as input, which represents the number of elements in a list.
   - Then takes `n` integers as input.
   - Removes all duplicate elements from the list and prints the updated list.

### 7. **Rotate List by K Positions**
   Write a C program that:
   - Takes an integer `n` as input, which represents the number of elements in a list.
   - Then takes `n` integers as input.
   - Takes an integer `k` as input, which represents the number of positions by which the list should be rotated.
   - Rotates the list by `k` positions to the right and prints the rotated list.

### 8. **Merge Two Sorted Lists**
   Write a C program that:
   - Takes two integers `n1` and `n2` as input, representing the number of elements in two sorted lists.
   - Then takes `n1` integers for the first sorted list and `n2` integers for the second sorted list.
   - Merges the two sorted lists into a single sorted list and prints the result.

### 9. **Find the Intersection of Two Lists**
   Write a C program that:
   - Takes two integers `n1` and `n2` as input, representing the number of elements in two lists.
   - Then takes `n1` integers for the first list and `n2` integers for the second list.
   - Finds and prints the elements that are common between the two lists (intersection).

### 10. **Find the Union of Two Lists**
   Write a C program that:
   - Takes two integers `n1` and `n2` as input, representing the number of elements in two lists.
   - Then takes `n1` integers for the first list and `n2` integers for the second list.
   - Finds and prints the union of the two lists (i.e., all unique elements from both lists).

### 11. **Cyclically Permute the List**
   Write a C program that:
   - Takes an integer `n` as input, which represents the number of elements in a list.
   - Then takes `n` integers as input.
   - Cyclically permutes the list one step to the right and prints the result.

These problems will help you practice manipulating arrays (lists) in C. Each task focuses on different fundamental operations such as searching, sorting, removing duplicates, and more.
